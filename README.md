Simple project that uses a Network Layer architecture that I learned recently. Pretty easy to use, maintenance and extend.

All base classes are placed in */Network* directory.

Files for supporting a specific backend (Memes Backend in this case) are placed in */Memes Backend* directory

You can easily support many backend and endpoints.
